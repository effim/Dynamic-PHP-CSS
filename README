WHAT IS THIS?

This is a very basic PHP script to get this project going. The goal is to
create a sort of CSS processor using PHP. The purpose is to generate
minimized, browser-friendly CSS from a regular stylesheet while introducing
additional shorthand properties and variables to allow for faster CSS
development. There is not yet an official milestone or feature-list for the
project â€“ it's in its infancy.

HOW TO USE IT? 

Change the name of the PHP script to your liking. Call it like so:

	css.php?style=stylesheet.css

The default style.css provided demonstrates using variables (versus
constants in the css) that allow you to pass values via the query string. 

	css.php?style=style.css&width=400px

profit off it, etc. A proper license will be added in the future.
